## React Vidz

This is a course project for [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

This is a small example of the core implementation of Redux into a React app.

To run this project, simply:

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

This project is instead meant to serve as a reference for proper Redux implementation in a React app.

**NOTES:**
  - This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
